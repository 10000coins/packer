## Assigning Values to build Variables

When variables are declared in the build of your configuration, they can be set
in a number of ways:

- Individually, with the `-var foo=bar` command line option.
- In variable definitions (`.pkrvars.hcl`) files, either specified on the
  command line or automatically loaded.
- As environment variables, for example: `PKR_VAR_foo=bar`
