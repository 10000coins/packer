# The `build` block

`@include 'from-1.5/beta-hcl2-note.mdx'`

The `build` block defines what builders are started and what they will do.

`@include 'from-1.5/builds/example-block.mdx'`

The list of available builders can be found in the [builders](/docs/builders)
section.

It is also possible to create and use [custom
builders](/docs/extending/custom-builders). There is also a list of [community
builders](/community-tools#community-builders).

Note that it is possible to set fields of a build block directly from the
build block of a [`build` block](/docs/from-1.5/blocks/build).
