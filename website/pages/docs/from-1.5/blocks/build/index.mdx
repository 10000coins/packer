# The `build` block

`@include 'from-1.5/beta-hcl2-note.mdx'`

The `build` block defines what builders are started, how to `provision` them
and if necessary what to do with their artifacts using `post-process`.

`@include 'from-1.5/builds/example-block.mdx'`


Define [top-level `source` blocks](/docs/from-1.5/blocks/source) to configure
your builders. The list of available builders can be found in the
[builders](/docs/builders) section.

To use builders in a `build` block you can either: 

* Set the `sources` array of string with references to defined sources.

* Define [build-level `source` blocks](/docs/from-1.5/blocks/build/source) or
`sources` to use builders. This also allow to set specific fields.

* A list of [community
builders](/community-tools#community-builders) is available.

* Create your own [custom builder](/docs/extending/custom-builders) !
