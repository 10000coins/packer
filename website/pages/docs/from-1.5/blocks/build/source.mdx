# The `source` block

`@include 'from-1.5/beta-hcl2-note.mdx'`

The `source` block in a `build` block allows to use an already defined source
and to set build fields of a source.

```hcl
# builds.pkr.hcl
build {
  source "amazon-ebs.example" {
    output = "specific-value"
  }
  #  ...
}
```

-> **Note:** If any top-level attribute is re-defined with the same name an
error will be displayed. In other words you cannot define the `output` field in
the source declaration **and** in the source usage.
