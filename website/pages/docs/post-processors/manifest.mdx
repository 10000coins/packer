# Manifest Post-Processor

Type: `manifest`

The manifest post-processor writes a JSON file with a list of all of the
artifacts packer produces during a run. If your packer template includes
multiple builds, this helps you keep track of which output artifacts (files,
AMI IDs, docker containers, etc.) correspond to each build.

The manifest post-processor is invoked each time a build completes and
_updates_ data in the manifest file. Builds are identified by name and type,
and include their build time, artifact ID, and file list.

If packer is run with the `-force` flag the manifest file will be truncated
automatically during each packer run. Otherwise, subsequent builds will be
added to the file. You can use the timestamps to see which is the latest
artifact.

You can specify manifest more than once and write each build to its own file,
or write all builds to the same file. For simple builds manifest only needs to
be specified once (see below) but you can also chain it together with other
post-processors such as Docker and Artifice.

## Configuration

### Optional:

@include 'post-processor/manifest/Config-not-required.mdx'

~> **Note**: Unlike most other post-processors, the	keep_input_artifact option doesn't apply for the manifest
post-processor. We will always retain the input artifact for manifest, since deleting the files we just recorded
is not a behavior anyone should	ever expect.

### Example Configuration

The minimal way to use the manifest post-processor is by just writing its definition, like:

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="JSON">

```json
{
  "post-processors": [
    {
      "type": "manifest"
    }
  ]
}
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="HCL2">

```hcl
post-processor "manifest" {}
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

A more complete example:

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="JSON">

```json
{
  "post-processors": [
    {
      "type": "manifest",
      "output": "manifest.json",
      "strip_path": true,
      "custom_data": {
        "my_custom_data": "example"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="HCL2">

```hcl
post-processor "manifest" {
    output = "manifest.json"
    strip_path = true
    custom_data = {
      my_custom_data = "example"
    }
}
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

An example JSON manifest file looks like:

```json
{
  "builds": [
    {
      "name": "example",
      "builder_type": "docker",
      "build_time": 1507245986,
      "files": [
        {
          "name": "packer_example",
          "size": 102219776
        }
      ],
      "artifact_id": "Container",
      "packer_run_uuid": "6d5d3185-fa95-44e1-8775-9e64fe2e2d8f",
      "custom_data": {
        "my_custom_data": "example"
      }
    }
  ],
  "last_run_uuid": "6d5d3185-fa95-44e1-8775-9e64fe2e2d8f"
}
```

If the build is run again, the new build artifacts will be added to the
manifest file rather than replacing it. It is possible to grab specific build
artifacts from the manifest by using `packer_run_uuid`.

The above manifest was generated with the following template:

<Tabs>
<Tab heading="JSON">

```json
{
  "builders": [
    {
      "type": "docker",
      "image": "ubuntu:latest",
      "export_path": "packer_example",
      "run_command": ["-d", "-i", "-t", "--entrypoint=/bin/bash", "{{.Image}}"]
    }
  ],
  "post-processors": [
    {
      "type": "manifest",
      "output": "manifest.json",
      "strip_path": true,
      "custom_data": {
        "my_custom_data": "example"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="HCL2">

```hcl
source "docker" "example" {
    image = "ubuntu:latest"
    export_path = "packer_example"
    run_command = ["-d", "-i", "-t", "--entrypoint=/bin/bash", "{{.Image}}"]
}

build {
    sources = ["source.docker.example"]

    post-processor "manifest" {
        output = "manifest.json"
        strip_path = true
        custom_data = {
          my_custom_data = "example"
        }
    }
}
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

If `output` was suffixed with `.pkrvar.hcl`, the following manifest would have
been created :

```hcl
manifest = {
  docker = {
    example = {
      artifact_id     = "Container"
      packer_run_uuid = "16c03321-fb77-1fd1-cfc4-c06d0e118802"
      files           = {
        name = "packer_example"
        size = 102219776
      }
      custom_data = {
        my_custom_data = "example"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Example usage:


<Tabs>
<Tab heading="JSON manifest">

The manifest can be very useful for cleaning up old artifacts, or printing
important values to logs. The following example uses jq, a command-line tool
for parsing json output, to find and echo the AWS ami-id of an ami created by a
build.

```bash

#!/bin/bash

AMI_ID=$(jq -r '.builds[-1].artifact_id' manifest.json | cut -d ":" -f2)
echo $AMI_ID

```

</Tab>
<Tab heading="HCL manifest">

The new HCL file could be used in Packer or Terraform to set an input value and
chain builds.

For example, if the manifest generated:

```hcl
manifest = {
  amazon-ebs = {
    old_build = {
      artifact_id     = "super_ami_id"
      # ...
    }
  }
}
```

We could then use the varfile like so:

```hcl
variable "manifest" {
}

source "amazon-ebs" "chained" {
  source_ami = var.manifest.amazon-ebs.old_build.artifact_id
}
```
